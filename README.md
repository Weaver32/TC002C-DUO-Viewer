# TC002C-Viewer
A Python script that (roughly) decodes the thermal data from a Topdon TC002C DUO thermal camera and displays it. Different from Topdon's Topview software, it allows color grade scaling and works for Windows and Linux. It might work for the other TC002 models as well but I haven't tested it.
